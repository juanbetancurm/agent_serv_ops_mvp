"""
what: a MemoryPort adapter that remembers incidents in a SQLite file.
why:  NullMemory forgets everything the moment the process ends, so every run
      began by believing it had never seen this container before. That is why
      every trace so far says "0 prior RB-002 incident(s)". With this adapter
      the count is real, and the third OOM in ten minutes can be described as a
      pattern rather than as news.
how:  one table, one file, no ORM. SQLite ships with Python, needs no server,
      and the file is gitignored (*.db) because it holds run history, not code.

      The clock lives HERE, not in the graph and never in a detector (rule 7).
      record() stamps the row with the time it was written, which is the only
      reason recent_incidents() can answer "in the last N hours" at all.
