"""
what: a MetricsPort adapter that answers from Prometheus instead of Docker.
why:  the Stage 2 payoff. The same seven keys, the same detector, the same
      graph and the same tests -- an entirely different source of truth, chosen
      by one line in run.py.

      It also brings a hazard Docker did not have. A live Docker read either
      works or raises; Prometheus will cheerfully answer with a five-minute-old
      number in exactly the same tone as a fresh one. Its instant queries look
      back up to five minutes by default, so an exporter that died four minutes
      ago still "reports" a healthy container.
how:  one instant query per read. A label selector fetches all six
      lab_container_* series for the container in a single round trip --
      __name__ can be matched like any other label -- and then the numbers are
      translated back into the contract's types (-1 becomes None, 1.0 becomes
      True), undoing the flattening the exporter had to do.

      Two situations are raised as errors rather than returned as plausible
      dicts: no series at all, and samples older than max_staleness_seconds.
      Both would otherwise read as "healthy container", which is the worst lie a
      monitoring agent can tell.
