"""
what: the durable checkpointer -- where a paused run is kept.
why:  interrupt() stops the graph and saves its state. Until now that state went
      into memory, so "paused" really meant "paused as long as this process
      lives". A human gate that cannot outlive the terminal it ran in is not a
      gate: nobody approves a production restart in the four seconds before the
      script gives up.

      With this, the pause is a row in a file. The process can exit, be killed,
      be deployed over, or move to another machine, and the answer can still
      arrive tomorrow.
how:  SqliteSaver over one connection, plus an explicit list of the types our
      state carries.

      That list is not decoration. LangGraph warns:

          Deserializing unregistered type agent.models.Incident from
          checkpoint. This will be blocked in a future version.

      and it is right to: loading arbitrary types out of a file is how a
      deserialisation vulnerability starts. Naming the two we actually use keeps
      the warning quiet AND keeps the door shut for everything else.
