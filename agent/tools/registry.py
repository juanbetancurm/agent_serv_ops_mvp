"""
what: the single function through which every tool call in the agent passes.
why:  one choke point means one place to enforce policy. The graph never calls a
      tool directly -- it calls dispatch(), and dispatch() decides what runs.

      This is the safety boundary of the whole project. The model may ask for
      anything; ALLOWED decides what is permitted -- in Python, not in prose. A
      tool named in a prompt is granted nothing; only this table grants.

      Rule 2 lives here: writes may only target lab-* containers. The tests for
      it -- restart_container(name="postgres"), names that merely look like
      lab-*, and a name that is not even a string -- were written and watched
      FAIL against the unguarded version of this file before these checks
      existed. A safety test that has never failed may be asserting nothing.

how:  REGISTRY maps a tool name to a function, and dispatch() calls it with the
      model's args. The gate is deliberately NOT injected into the graph as a
      swappable dependency: metrics sources are adapters and should be
      swappable, but a safety boundary that run.py could replace with a more
      permissive one is not a safety boundary.
