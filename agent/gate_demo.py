"""
what: the human gate, both answers, in one process.
why:  a list of passing tests does not show what a pause IS. This runs the same
      incident twice -- approved once, denied once -- and prints what the human
      was shown, what the agent then did, and what each answer left in the audit
      trail.
how:  fake tools and MockLLM, so it costs nothing and touches no container. An
      in-memory checkpointer is enough here because both halves happen in one
      process; Step 4 swaps it for SQLite, which is what lets the pause survive
      the process being killed.
