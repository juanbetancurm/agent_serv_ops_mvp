"""
what: tests for the tool dispatcher -- first the plumbing, then the safety
      boundary.
why:  the safety tests at the bottom are the safety story of the whole project.
      They were written while the dispatcher was still unguarded and run red
      against it first: a safety test you have never seen fail might be
      asserting nothing at all.
how:  call dispatch() directly with the args shape the model produces, and
      assert either an observation string or a ToolNotAllowed refusal.
