"""
what: one fixture, applied automatically to every test: the tool registry points
      at the fake tools.
why:  from Stage 1 the real tools talk to Docker. get_container_logs reads a
      real container, and restart_container really restarts one. A suite that
      did that would need Docker Desktop running, would be slow, and would
      restart containers as a side effect of `pytest`. Rule 5 says the suite
      stays offline and free, forever -- so the tools get swapped at the
      boundary, the same way MockLLM stands in for a model.
how:  an autouse fixture plus monkeypatch.setitem on REGISTRY, undone after each
      test. ALLOWED is NOT touched: the policy under test stays the real one,
      and the refusal tests still exercise the real dispatcher -- they never
      reach a tool anyway, because dispatch() raises before calling one.

      conftest.py is pytest's own convention: fixtures defined here apply to
      every test in this folder without being imported anywhere.
